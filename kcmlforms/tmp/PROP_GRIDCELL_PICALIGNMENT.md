*(Default, TopLeft, TopCenter, TopRight, MiddleLeft, MiddleCenter, MiddleRight, BottomLeft, BottomCenter, BottomRight, Tile, Stretch, Fit)*

**Specifies the picture alignment**

The **PictureAlignment** property is used to determine where the picture is placed on the control. The default is to stretch the picture to fit the entire area of the control. The possible values are described under the generic [PictureAlignment](PROP_BUTTON_PICALIGNMENT.htm) property.: .gridControl1.Cell(r, c).PictureAlignment = &.MiddleCenter

This grid cell property is not stored on the server and therefore cannot be inspected by server code. If set on the server it will be passed down to the client but no record is kept on the server.

The **Default** behaviour of an enumerated gridcell property is to check for an overriding setting using the [prededence rules](../GridCellPrecedence.htm) and if not set elsewhere to use the next setting from the enumeration, in this case **TopLeft**.
